          <p className="blog-meta">Published on September 2025 ‚Ä¢ 5 min read</p>
          <p>
            Ambur Biryani is not just a dish ‚Äì it‚Äôs a story that began in the
            18th century under the Nawabs of Arcot. Crafted with{" "}
            <strong>jeera samba rice</strong>, tender meat, and a special{" "}
            <em>dried red chili paste</em>, this biryani has a unique balance of
            flavor, heat, and aroma that sets it apart from other styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike spice-heavy versions, Ambur Biryani uses fewer masalas, which
            lets the natural flavors of the meat shine through. Cooked using the
            traditional <em>dum</em> method, every grain of rice absorbs the
            rich aroma of the spices and meat, making it truly irresistible.
